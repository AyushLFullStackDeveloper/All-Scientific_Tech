      description: "Performing planned maintenance on CO₂ incubators is crucial to ensuring optimal cell culture conditions, preventing contamination, and maintaining consistent temperature, humidity, and CO₂ levels. Regular maintenance helps prevent the buildup of bacteria, fungi, and other contaminants that could compromise research or clinical results. It also ensures that sensors, filters, and humidification systems function correctly, reducing the risk of equipment failure and costly downtime. By following a scheduled maintenance plan, laboratories can extend the lifespan of their incubators, improve experimental reproducibility, and comply with industry standards and regulatory requirements.",

      description: "Performing planned maintenance and calibration on a centrifuge is essential to ensure accurate, reliable, and safe operation. Regular maintenance helps prevent mechanical failures, imbalances, and excessive wear on critical components such as rotors, bearings, and seals, reducing the risk of costly downtime or equipment damage. Calibration ensures that the centrifuge operates at the correct speed and force, which is crucial for obtaining reproducible results in laboratory processes. Proper upkeep also enhances user safety by minimizing the risk of rotor failure, which can lead to hazardous situations. By following a scheduled maintenance and calibration plan, laboratories can maintain compliance with industry regulations, extend the lifespan of the equipment, and improve overall experimental accuracy.",
